About the Project
The Sign Language Translator is an AI-powered web application designed to recognize and translate Indian Sign Language (ISL) alphabets from images or real-time webcam feed into text.
It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the ISL Aâ€“Z dataset to detect hand gestures with high accuracy.
The project aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and non-sign language users by providing an easy-to-use digital translator.
